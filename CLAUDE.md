# WonderHome — Claude Code Autonomous Build Contract

## Mission
Build **WonderHome** from this package as an AI-driven Household Operating System. It is a greenfield project and must use the WonderArk/founder-collab-aligned technical stack documented in `TECH-STACK-AND-NFR.md`.

## Mandatory startup
1. Inspect the repository. If it is empty, start with `backlogs/00-Project-Bootstrap-and-Architecture.md`.
2. Read `TECH-STACK-AND-NFR.md`.
3. Read `tracking/PROGRESS.md` and `tracking/IMPLEMENTATION-ORDER.md`.
4. Read `architecture/API-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `architecture/SECURITY-BASELINE.md` and `database/SUPABASE-DATABASE.md`.
5. For any UI work, read `design/UI-UX-REQUIREMENTS-v3.md` (the UI/UX contract) and `design/DESIGN-NOTES.md` (the rules the components encode).
6. Pick the first dependency-ready incomplete story.

## Autonomous execution
For each story: mark In Progress → inspect existing code → implement → test → typecheck/lint/build → fix → update docs/migrations/contracts → mark Done → update overall/module trackers → continue automatically.

Do not ask “what next?”. Ask only for genuinely blocking product, security/privacy, destructive migration, production credential or irreversible architecture decisions.

## Stack is fixed unless explicitly changed
- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript 5.9.x
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Radix UI + Lucide React
- Supabase PostgreSQL + `@supabase/ssr` / `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Vercel AI SDK
- **Anthropic Claude primary AI provider; Google Gemini and OpenAI configurable alternatives**
- Zod + React Hook Form
- Vitest + Playwright
- npm workspaces with `apps/web` and `packages/*`

Do not switch to React Native, a different backend framework, Clerk, Prisma or another ORM without an explicit architecture decision. The mobile-first requirement means responsive Next.js/PWA-capable web UI, not React Native.

## Product rules
- Manage outcomes, not micro-task checklists.
- Normal household routines are silent.
- Househelpers do not need to update every chore.
- Notifications are precise, timely, recipient-specific, actionable, grouped, threaded and automatically resolved.
- Talk and text share one conversation engine.
- One household has multiple identities and personalized views.
- Head of Family can designate Household Administrators.
- Children have age-appropriate access and privacy.
- Manage Household defines responsibilities, playbook, routines, policies and AI autonomy.
- Certification exposes what WonderHome believes and lets authorized users correct it.
- AI agents use governed APIs/tools and never directly mutate Supabase.
- Server-side authorization is authoritative.
- Sensitive actions require appropriate approval/step-up authentication.

## External providers
Never invent credentials or claim a live integration. Build provider-neutral interfaces and deterministic mocks/fixtures first. A real provider is considered live only after credentials, authentication, contract behavior and integration tests are configured.

## Non-functional gates
Use the targets in `TECH-STACK-AND-NFR.md`. P0 security and authorization tests are release blockers. Core API targets are p95 <=500ms reads and <=800ms ordinary writes excluding external provider latency.

## Progress
`tracking/PROGRESS.md` is the overall source of truth. Every story status change must be reflected there and in the module file. Never fabricate completion.
